name: A set of deep learning algorithms for air quality prediction applications
description: A set of machine learning algorithms, including grid-based (Bidirectional
  Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory) and graph-based (Attention Temporal Graph
  Convolutional Network) algorithms were used to predict air quality. The methods
  were implemented on a spatiotemporal combination of air quality, meteorological
  and traffic data of the city of Madrid. The two methods are exposed to be reused
  for prediction in other scenarios and different air quality phenomena.
